## Purpose

This policy ensures the firm meets its obligations under SEC Rule 17a-3 (records to be made) and Rule 17a-4 (records to be preserved) for maintaining accurate and complete books and records.

## Required Records

The firm must make and maintain the following records:

1. **Trade blotters** — Itemized daily records of all purchases and sales of securities.
2. **Customer account records** — Including name, address, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.
3. **Order tickets** — Records of all orders including time of receipt, execution, and cancellation.
4. **Communications** — All business-related communications including email, instant messages, and social media.
5. **Financial statements** — Trial balances, income statements, and balance sheets.

## Record Integrity

All records must be accurate, complete, and maintained in a manner that allows prompt retrieval. Falsification or intentional destruction of records is a violation of federal securities law and grounds for immediate termination and regulatory referral.

## Electronic Records

Electronic records must be stored in WORM-compliant systems. The firm must maintain backup copies in a separate location and conduct annual testing of record retrieval systems.
