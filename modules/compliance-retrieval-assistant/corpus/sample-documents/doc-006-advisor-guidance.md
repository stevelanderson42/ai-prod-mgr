## Purpose

This guidance outlines advisor obligations under Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) and FINRA suitability requirements when making investment recommendations.

## Reg BI Obligations

Under SEC Regulation Best Interest, broker-dealers must act in the best interest of the retail customer at the time of a recommendation. This requires:

1. **Disclosure Obligation** — Provide full and fair disclosure of material facts about the relationship, including conflicts of interest.
2. **Care Obligation** — Exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill in making recommendations.
3. **Conflict of Interest Obligation** — Establish policies to identify, disclose, and mitigate conflicts.
4. **Compliance Obligation** — Establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance.

## Suitability

Advisors must have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy is suitable for the customer based on their investment profile, including:

- Financial situation and needs
- Investment objectives
- Risk tolerance
- Time horizon
- Liquidity needs

## Prohibited Practices

- Making recommendations without understanding the customer's profile
- Recommending unsuitable products to meet sales targets
- Guaranteeing or promising specific investment returns or outcomes
- Omitting material risk disclosures from recommendations
