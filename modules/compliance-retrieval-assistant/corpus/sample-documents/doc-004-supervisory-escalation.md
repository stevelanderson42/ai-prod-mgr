# Supervisory Escalation Guide

Escalate to a supervisor/compliance when:
- The communication includes performance guarantees or promissory language.
- The user requests personalized investment advice without suitability context.
- The message contains prohibited language or misleading claims.
- The user is upset and threatens complaints or litigation.
- The message involves privacy, account access, or security concerns.

Expected workflow:
1) Pause response if uncertain.
2) Provide a neutral holding response.
3) Capture context and route to compliance queue.
4) Document the reason for escalation.

Holding response example:
"I can’t confirm that directly. I’m going to route this to our compliance team to ensure accuracy."
