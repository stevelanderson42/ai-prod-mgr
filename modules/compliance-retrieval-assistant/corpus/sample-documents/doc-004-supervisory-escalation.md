## Purpose

This document defines when and how compliance matters must be escalated to supervisory personnel. Prompt escalation is essential for regulatory compliance and risk management.

## Escalation Triggers

The following events require immediate escalation to the designated supervisor:

1. **Client complaints** — Any written or verbal complaint from a client about investment advice, account handling, or advisor conduct.
2. **Regulatory inquiries** — Any communication from FINRA, the SEC, or state regulators.
3. **Suspicious activity** — Transactions or patterns that may indicate market manipulation, insider trading, or money laundering.
4. **Policy violations** — Any known or suspected violation of firm policies, including use of prohibited language in communications.
5. **Material errors** — Trade errors, account misallocations, or pricing mistakes exceeding $500.

## Escalation Process

1. Document the issue in the compliance incident tracking system within 24 hours.
2. Notify the direct supervisor and the Chief Compliance Officer via secure email.
3. Do not communicate with the client about the escalation until approved by compliance.
4. Preserve all related records and communications.

## Failure to Escalate

Failure to escalate a known compliance issue is itself a policy violation subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
