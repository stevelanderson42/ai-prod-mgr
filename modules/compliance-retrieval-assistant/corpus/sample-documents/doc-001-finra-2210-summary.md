## Overview

FINRA Rule 2210 governs communications by member firms with the public. It establishes content standards, approval requirements, and filing obligations for retail communications, correspondence, and institutional communications.

## Key Requirements

### Fair and Balanced

All communications must be fair and balanced. They must provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts regarding any particular security or type of security, industry, or service. No member may make any false, exaggerated, unwarranted, promissory, or misleading statement or claim in any communication.

### Prohibited Content

Communications may not predict or project performance, imply that past performance will recur, or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim. Guarantees of investment returns are strictly prohibited.

### Risk Disclosure

Communications that discuss potential benefits must also disclose the corresponding risks. Any comparison between investments must disclose all material differences, including investment objectives, costs, and liquidity.

### Approval and Supervision

A registered principal must approve retail communications before use unless an exception applies. Institutional communications require policies and procedures to supervise content but do not require pre-approval by a principal.

## Enforcement Context

FINRA has brought numerous enforcement actions for violations of Rule 2210, including cases involving promissory statements about investment returns, misleading social media posts, and failure to disclose material risks.
