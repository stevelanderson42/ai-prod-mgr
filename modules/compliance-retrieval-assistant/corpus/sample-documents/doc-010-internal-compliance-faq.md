## Purpose

Frequently asked questions from advisors and staff regarding compliance policies and procedures.

---

**Q: Can I tell a client that an investment is "safe" or "guaranteed"?**

A: No. You may not describe any security or investment strategy as safe, guaranteed, or risk-free. All investments carry risk, and representing otherwise violates FINRA Rule 2210 and firm policy. Even government bonds carry interest rate risk and inflation risk. Use factual language about historical performance with appropriate disclosures. Guaranteeing investment returns is one of the most common compliance violations and can result in disciplinary action, fines, and termination.

---

**Q: What do I do if a client asks me to promise a specific return?**

A: Explain that no investment return can be guaranteed and that regulations prohibit such promises. You may discuss historical performance, expected ranges based on asset allocation models, and the relationship between risk and potential return. Document the conversation and the client's expectations.

**Q: Do I need compliance approval before sending an email to a client?**

A: Routine correspondence (one-to-one emails about account matters) generally does not require pre-approval but is subject to supervision and review. Retail communications (emails sent to more than 25 retail clients within 30 days) require principal approval before distribution.

---

**Q: What records do I need to keep and for how long?**

A: Client communications must be retained for a minimum of 3 years per SEC Rule 17a-4. Account records must be retained for 6 years. All electronic communications are automatically archived by firm systems. Do not delete business communications from any platform.

---

**Q: Can I use AI tools to draft client communications?**

A: AI-generated content for client communications must go through the same compliance review process as any other communication. AI outputs must be reviewed for accuracy, grounded in approved sources, and must not contain prohibited language or unsubstantiated claims. The advisor remains responsible for all content sent to clients regardless of how it was drafted.
