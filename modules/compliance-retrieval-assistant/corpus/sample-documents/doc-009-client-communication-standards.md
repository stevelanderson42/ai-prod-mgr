## Purpose

This document establishes standards for all client-facing communications to ensure consistency, accuracy, and regulatory compliance across channels including email, letters, presentations, and social media.

## General Standards

1. **Accuracy** — All statements must be accurate and not misleading. Claims about products, services, or performance must be substantiated.
2. **Balance** — Communications discussing benefits must give equal prominence to associated risks and limitations.
3. **Clarity** — Language must be clear and understandable to the intended audience. Avoid jargon unless writing to institutional clients.
4. **Disclosures** — Required disclosures must be prominent, not buried in footnotes or fine print.

## Performance Reporting

When discussing investment performance:
- Always include appropriate time periods
- Use standardized calculation methods
- Include "Past performance is not indicative of future results" disclosure
- Never guarantee or promise future investment returns or outcomes
- Do not cherry-pick favorable time periods while omitting unfavorable ones

## Social Media

Social media posts are subject to the same standards as all other communications. Informal tone does not exempt content from compliance requirements. All social media used for business purposes must be archived.

## Review and Approval

Retail communications require principal pre-approval. The compliance department maintains a library of pre-approved templates and language for common communication needs.
