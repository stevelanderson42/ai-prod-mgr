## Purpose

This template provides standard risk disclosure language for use in client-facing investment communications. All investment recommendations must include appropriate risk disclosures.

## General Investment Risk Disclosure

> Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives. The value of investments may fluctuate, and investors may receive back less than they invested.

## Asset-Class-Specific Disclosures

### Equities

> Equity investments are subject to market risk, including the risk of loss of principal. Stock prices may be volatile and are influenced by company-specific factors and broader market conditions.

### Fixed Income

> Bond investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate.

### Alternative Investments

> Alternative investments involve a high degree of risk and are suitable only for sophisticated investors. These investments are illiquid, may have limited transparency, and there is no guarantee of returns. Investors may lose their entire investment.

## Guarantee Prohibition Notice

Under no circumstances should any advisor or representative guarantee investment returns or promise specific performance outcomes to clients. Guaranteeing returns violates FINRA Rule 2210 and firm policy. Any communication that implies guaranteed performance must be reported to the compliance department immediately.
