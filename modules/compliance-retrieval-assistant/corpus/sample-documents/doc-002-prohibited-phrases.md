## Purpose

This document lists phrases and language patterns that must not appear in client-facing communications. These restrictions are derived from FINRA Rule 2210, SEC guidance, and internal compliance policy.

## Prohibited Phrases

### Guarantees and Promises

The following phrases are prohibited because they imply guaranteed investment returns or eliminate the perception of risk:

- "guaranteed returns"
- "risk-free investment"
- "you will earn"
- "guaranteed to increase"
- "no possibility of loss"
- "safe investment" (when referring to securities)
- "guaranteed profit"
- "promise you will make money"
- "cannot lose"
- "assured income"

### Promissory Language

Advisors must not use language that constitutes a promise or guarantee of future investment performance. Statements such as "this investment will return 10%" or "you are guaranteed to double your money" are strictly prohibited.

### Superlatives Without Substantiation

Phrases like "best investment," "top-performing fund," or "number one in the industry" require factual substantiation and source attribution. Without supporting data, these phrases are prohibited.

## Permissible Alternatives

Instead of guarantees, advisors should use language that accurately reflects investment risk:

- "historically this asset class has performed…"
- "based on past performance, which is not indicative of future results…"
- "this investment carries risks including…"
