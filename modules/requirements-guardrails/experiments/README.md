**Module:** Requirements Guardrails  
**Purpose:** Link prompt engineering work to guardrail design decisions.

## Why This Matters

The Requirements Guardrails module didn't emerge from theory — it was informed by hands-on prompt engineering experiments. This folder documents that connection:

- **Which experiments** informed which guardrail rules
- **What patterns** emerged from V1 → V2 refinements
- **How learnings** were codified into classification logic

---

## Traceability Value

For interviews and portfolio review, this folder demonstrates:

1. **Evidence-based design** — Guardrail rules trace to real experiments
2. **Iterative refinement** — V1 → V2 patterns show learning progression
3. **PM-to-engineering handoff** — Experiments become specifications
