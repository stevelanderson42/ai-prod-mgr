# Outputs Folder

## Purpose

This folder contains **decision artifacts**—the final outputs of the ROI Engine evaluation process.

These documents represent the culmination of intake, scoring, and evidence gathering, packaged for stakeholder review and organizational decision-making.

## What Goes Here

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `decision-memo.md` | Structured recommendation document summarizing scores, rationale, and next steps |

Templates for these artifacts live in this folder (see `decision-memo-template.md`).

Completed memos for specific opportunities live in `/samples`.

## Decision Memo Purpose

The Decision Memo is designed to:

1. **Summarize** the opportunity in executive-readable format
2. **Present** scores with transparent rationale
3. **Surface** key assumptions and risks
4. **Recommend** a path forward (or deliberate pause)
5. **Enable** informed conversation, not algorithmic verdicts

---

## Audience

Decision Memos are written for:

- **Executive sponsors** — need the "so what" quickly
- **Compliance/Legal** — need to see regulatory considerations elevated
- **Engineering leads** — need feasibility concerns surfaced
- **Finance** — need to understand ROI assumptions and confidence levels

The memo format balances brevity with auditability.
