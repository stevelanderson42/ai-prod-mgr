The Board approved three rule proposals. It also reviewed FINRA’s 2025 financial performance and approved FINRA’s 2026 budget. More information about FINRA\u0027s finances will be provided in FINRA’s annual financial report and budget summary.\n Rulemaking\n The three rule proposals reflect feedback FINRA has received on the rule modernization effort that is part of  FINRA Forward , a  series of initiatives to improve FINRA’s effectiveness and efficiency in pursuing its mission of protecting investors and safeguarding market integrity.\n “The Board’s approval of these three rule proposals reflects FINRA’s commitment to modernizing our regulatory framework while strengthening investor protections for an evolving marketplace. By enabling electronic delivery as a default option, we’re aligning our rules with how many investors prefer to receive information in the digital age. Our enhanced safeguards against financial exploitation demonstrate our determination to protect vulnerable investors, particularly seniors, from fraud and abuse. And by updating our new issue rules for collective trust funds, we’re ensuring retirement savers have equitable access to investment opportunities,” said  FINRA Board Chair Scott Curtis .\n The three rule proposals are:\n - Electronic Delivery Default:  The Board approved a proposal to permit member firms to use electronic delivery as the default means of providing information to customers under FINRA rules. The proposal supports modern communication practices and preferences while preserving customers’ ability to choose paper delivery. FINRA plans to file the proposed rule changes with the SEC and publish related guidance in a Regulatory Notice.\n - Customer Protection from Financial Exploitation:  The Board approved a proposal that would better equip member firms to protect customers from financial exploitation. The proposal includes amendments to boost the adoption and usefulness of customers\u0027 trusted contacts and allow member firms greater flexibility to extend temporary holds when they reasonably suspect financial exploitation of a senior or vulnerable adult. It would also offer member firms a new optional shorter temporary hold (a “speed bump”) to protect customers of any age from suspected fraud. FINRA will issue a Regulatory Notice seeking comment on the proposal.\n - Collective Trust Fund Flexibility: The Board approved a proposal that would provide more flexibility for collective trust funds—sometimes referred to as collective investment trusts— to receive initial public offering allocations under FINRA’s new issue rules. The exemption would treat these pooled investment vehicles, which are generally used as investment options in qualified retirement plans, comparably to other types of pooled investments. FINRA plans to file the proposal with the SEC.\n Additional Updates\n The Board received an update on FINRA’s  2026 Regulatory Oversight Report , a key resource for member firms with insights from FINRA’s regulatory operations programs, including findings and best practices.\n The Board also received an  update on the ongoing external review of FINRA’s enforcement program, as well as the enhancements being made to FINRA’s organizational structure to align with the demands of FINRA’s mission. This includes the ongoing work to operationalize two new groups: Regulatory Operations and Market and Regulatory Services.\n The Board also met with Investment Company Institute President and CEO Eric Pan, who joined the meeting to discuss issues that are top of mind for the asset management industry, including exchange-traded fund share classes of mutual funds.\n More information about the Board\u0027s operations, including membership and responsibilities of its committees, is available  here .\n In related news, FINRA announced the winners of the recent Small Firm Advisory Committee (SFAC) and Regional Committee elections, as well as those who were appointed to serve on the SFAC and the National Adjudicatory Council.

FINRA Forward is a  series of initiatives to improve FINRA’s effectiveness and efficiency in pursuing its mission of protecting investors and safeguarding market integrity. Member firms have said they use the report to identify the findings and effective practices that are applicable to their businesses, incorporate the reports’ topics in their risk assessment processes, perform a gap analysis of their compliance programs, and for training, among other uses, which are detailed in the report.\n “Our 2026 FINRA Regulatory Oversight Report captures important findings and translates them into practical guidance our member firms can act on immediately. We are not just identifying risks, we are equipping our member firms with the intelligence and resources needed to mitigate risks effectively. By sharing these insights, FINRA is engaging with members to help strengthen their defenses. Ultimately, this report is essential because member firm compliance protects investors and safeguards the integrity of our markets,” said  Greg Ruppert, Executive Vice President and Chief Regulatory Operations Officer at FINRA .\n “Whether it\u0027s about the evolving threat of cyberattacks including those powered by bad actors exploiting artificial intelligence, the increase in manipulation tactics that exploit market participants, or the need to protect senior investors from potential fraud and other threats, this report delivers useful, real-world insights from our regulatory oversight work. Our goal is simple: help firms build stronger compliance programs and more resilient operations so that investors can participate in markets with greater confidence,” Ruppert added. \n Among the topics covered in the report are generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), cybersecurity and cyber-enabled fraud; manipulative trading in small-cap, exchange-listed equities; and third-party risk landscape. For each topic area covered, the report identifies the relevant rule(s); summarizes noteworthy findings from recent oversight activities involving firms; outlines firms’ effective practices that FINRA observed through its oversight activities; and provides additional resources that may be helpful to firms in reviewing their supervisory procedures and controls and fulfilling their compliance obligations.\n GenAI\n Through FINRA’s survey of firms and engagement with other regulators, FINRA has noted that:\n - firms have started to implement GenAI solutions with a focus on efficiency gains, particularly with respect to internal processes and information retrieval; and\n - the top GenAI use case among FINRA member firms is “Summarization and Information Extraction,” which refers to condensing large volumes of text and extracting specific entities, relationships or key information from unstructured documents. \n The report notes that AI agents—systems or programs that are capable of autonomously performing and completing tasks on behalf of a user—can enhance GenAI capabilities by providing users with additional opportunities for task automation and the ability to interact with a wider range of data and systems faster and at a potentially lower cost than more traditional process automation. \n However, the report details notable risks and challenges that could result in adverse impacts to investors, firms or the markets, which include:\n - Autonomy: AI agents acting autonomously without human validation and approval\n - Scope and authority: Agents may act beyond the user’s actual or intended scope and authority\n - Auditability and transparency: Complicated, multi-step agent reasoning tasks can make outcomes difficult to trace or explain, complicating auditability\n - Data sensitivity: Agents operating on sensitive data may unintentionally store, explore, disclose, or misuse sensitive or proprietary information\n - Domain knowledge: General-purpose AI agents may lack the necessary domain knowledge to effectively and consistently carry out a complex and industry-specific tasks\n - Rewards and reinforcement: Misaligned or poorly designed reward functions could result in the agent optimizing decisions that could negatively impact investors, firms, or markets\n - Unique risks of GenAI: Bias, hallucinations, privacy, etc., also remain present and applicable for GenAI agents and their outputs\n Cybersecurity and Cyber-Enabled Fraud\n FINRA has observed a variety of sophisticated cybersecurity threats targeting member firms and their customers, including:\n - Ransomware and extortion events\n - Data breaches\n - Phishing, smishing or quishing\n - New account fraud\n - Account takeovers\n - Account impersonations\n - Imposter sites\n Manipulative Trading—Increase in Small-Cap Fraud Involving Exchange-Listed Equities\n FINRA has observed the following trends in manipulative pump-and-dump schemes involving small-cap exchange-listed equities:\n - They are occurring less frequently at the time of the small-cap issuers’ initial public offerings (IPOs), and more frequently months after these IPOs.\n - Suspected nominee accounts continue to be utilized to invest in small-cap IPOs to aid in bringing companies public.\n - In advance of the pump-and-dump scheme, nominee accounts may “funnel,” or sell their shares in a coordinated manner to one or more foreign omnibus accounts, which result in the omnibus account(s) holding a significant portion of the public float.\n - Well after the issuer’s IPO, the issuer may sell a large amount of shares in a privately placed secondary offering to select foreign investors—lacking adequate public disclosure—leading to these investors holding a large amount of the issuer’s public float.\n - The use of account takeover fraud to purchase shares of small cap companies that are the subject of pump-and-dump schemes.\n - A continued increase in the use of text messaging and social media-based scams to attract victims to purchase shares of small-cap issuers subject to pump-and-dump schemes.\n - The victims’ purchases occur in conjunction with—and likely cause—price increases in the targeted securities through the use of coordinated limit orders. \n In October, FINRA initiated a  targeted examination of firm practices regarding public and private offerings of small-cap exchange-listed issuers with business operations in foreign jurisdictions.\n Third-Party Risk Landscape\n FINRA has observed an increase in the reporting of cyberattacks and outages at firms’ third-party vendors. Given the financial industry’s reliance on third-party vendors to support key systems and covered functions, an attempted cyberattack or an outage at a third-party provider could potentially impact a large number of member firms. FINRA continues to monitor third-party provider risks in the interests of member firms. \n The report outlines effective practices, such as conducting initial and ongoing due diligence on third-party vendors supporting mission-critical systems, maintaining an inventory of firm data types accessed or stored by the firm’s vendors, and monitoring third-party vendor services for vulnerabilities or data breaches, among other practices.\n FINRA Unscripted Podcast Episode About the 2026 FINRA Regulatory Oversight Report\n A  FINRA Unscripted podcast episode about the 2026 FINRA Regulatory Oversight Report—featuring  Ornella Bergeron, Senior Vice President, Risk Monitoring, and Acting Head of Member Supervision ,  Bill St. Louis Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement , and  Feral Talib, Executive Vice President and Head of Market Oversight and guest hosted by  Bryan Smith, Senior Vice President and Acting Head of Strategic Intelligence —is available on FINRA’s website (a transcript is provided). In addition, the subjects covered in the report will be featured in other FINRA-related compliance and education resources throughout the year, including at the  2026 FINRA Annual Conference  taking place May 12-14 in Washington, D.C.\n Here is a full list of topics covered in the 2026 FINRA Regulatory Oversight Report:\n - Financial Crimes Prevention - Cybersecurity and Cyber-Enabled Fraud\n - Anti-Money Laundering, Fraud and Sanctions\n - Manipulative Trading\n \n - GenAI: Continuing and Emerging Trends\n - Firm Operations - Third-Party Risk Landscape\n - Outside Business Activities and Private Securities Transactions\n - Books and Records\n - Senior Investors and Trusted Contact Persons\n \n - Member Firms’ Nexus to Crypto\n - Communications and Sales - Communications with the Public\n - Reg BI and Form CRS\n - Private Placements\n - Annuities Securities Products\n \n - Market Integrity - Consolidated Audit Trail\n - Customer Order Handling: Best Execution and Order Routing Disclosures\n - Fixed Income—Fair Pricing\n - Market Access Rule\n - Extended Hours Trading\n \n - Financial Management - Net Capital\n - Liquidity Risk Management\n - Protection of Customer Assets\n \n About FINRA\n FINRA is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to investor protection and market integrity.

The report builds on previous NFCS Investor Survey reports (conducted in 2021, 2018 and 2015), and includes new or expanded topics, such as attitudes towards risk, reliance on finfluencers and awareness of investment fraud.\n Key Findings: \n - New investors.  The pace at which new investors are entering the market has declined significantly. In the 2024 NFCS, 8% of investors reported beginning to invest within the last two years—a sharp drop from the 21% who began investing in the two years preceding the 2021 NFCS.\n - Investor characteristics.  While the overall proportion of U.S. adults with investments held outside of retirement accounts did not materially change from 2021, fewer young adults (21% vs. 26% in 2021), men (40% vs. 43% in 2021), and persons of color (29% vs. 36% in 2021) reported owning non-retirement investments in 2024, largely erasing the gains made in the prior wave.\n - Risk attitudes.  The proportion of those willing to take substantial risks in their investment portfolios declined to just 8% in 2024 from 12% in 2021. Among investors under 35, those willing to take substantial risk dropped to 15% from 24%. Despite this, over one-third of investors (34%) feel they need to take big risks to reach their financial goals, including 62% of investors under 35.\n - Risk-taking.  Compared to older investors, those under 35 are more likely to engage in investment behaviors that can carry greater risk, including trading options (43% vs. 10% of those 55 and older) and making purchases on margin (22% vs. 4% of those 55 and older).\n - Social media.  Twenty-nine percent of investors report relying on social media as an information source. When asked separately about the social channels they use for investing information, YouTube emerged as the most popular, used by 30% of respondents overall and 61% of those under 35.\n - Finfluencers. Over a quarter of investors (26%) use recommendations from social media influencers when making investment decisions, including 61% of those under 35 and 57% of those with less than two years of investing experience.\n - Meme stock popularity.  Thirteen percent of investors report buying meme stocks or other viral investments, including nearly one-third (29%) of investors under 35.\n - Crypto interest . While the percentage investing in cryptocurrency in 2024 did not change from 2021 (27%), fewer investors reported considering cryptocurrency investments (either purchasing more or for the first time), dropping to 26% in 2024 from 33% in 2021.\n - Investment information sources.  The most commonly used sources of investment information are research and tools provided by brokerage firms (75%), recommendations from financial professionals (69%), business and finance articles (67%), and word of mouth from friends/family/colleagues (65%).\n - Investment fraud.  Concern over investment fraud has increased somewhat. Thirty-seven percent of investors are worried about losing money due to investment fraud, up from 31% in 2021. Still, the vast majority (89%) do not believe they have been targeted in an investment scam.\n - Low investing knowledge.  On average, respondents answered slightly less than half of the investing quiz questions correctly (5.3 out of 11 questions). Questions about margin and short selling had the most incorrect answers, with over half of respondents answering each incorrectly (55% and 54%, respectively). Notably, 75% of those who actually make purchases on margin incorrectly answered the margin question.\n NOTE: The FINRA Foundation will hold a virtual press conference about the report, Investors in the United States: Results from the FINRA Foundation’s National Financial Capability Study, at 11 a.m. E.T. today.

This $2 million in restitution will make affected customers whole, but prevention should always be the priority.”\n Between January 2018 and June 2024, when it became part of Osaic Wealth, Inc., Securities America effected the purchase of approximately $3.8 billion in Class A mutual fund shares, which generated a substantial portion of the firm’s revenue. Nonetheless, the firm failed to implement a system, including written policies and procedures, reasonably designed to supervise recommendations of Class A shares for compliance with FINRA  Rule 2111 (Suitability) and Regulation Best Interest’s Care Obligation. The Care Obligation requires broker-dealers and associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care and skill when making recommendations to retail customers. \n Securities America’s supervisory system was not reasonably designed to detect switches and short-term sales. Even when the firm identified such trades, the firm failed to reasonably review them to ensure that representatives had reasonably considered fees and commissions. As a result, the firm failed to reasonably supervise recommendations of more than 1,000 Class A mutual fund switches and more than 2,000 short-term sales that were potentially unsuitable or not in the customer’s best interest. Collectively, these trades caused customers to pay $2,019,040 in commissions and fees, which will now be returned to them. This matter originated from a FINRA cycle examination.\n Mutual funds offer different share classes, each with its own fee structure. Class A mutual fund shares typically collect a front-end sales charge when purchasing the fund, but this fee is typically waived when a customer exchanges a mutual fund for a new fund within the same fund family. Class C shares, by contrast, charge higher ongoing annual fees than Class A shares but typically have no upfront load. \n When a representative recommends switching from one fund family to another, the customer pays a new front-end sales charge on Class A shares—a cost that could be avoided by staying within the original fund family. Similarly, selling a Class A mutual fund shortly after buying it creates a risk that a customer has paid an upfront fee without holding the investment long enough to benefit from it. \n In settling this matter, Securities America consented to the entry of FINRA’s findings, without admitting or denying the charges. \n FINRA makes available disciplinary actions and other information on its  Disciplinary Actions Online  database.

In certain instances, First Trust preconditioned the non-cash compensation on client firm representatives achieving sales targets with respect to First Trust products ( e.g. , exchange-traded funds and unit investment trusts). In addition, First Trust wholesalers, who are generally responsible for marketing and selling financial products to client firms, falsified internal expense records, and First Trust sent client firms reports containing inaccurate information about the value, nature and frequency of non-cash compensation that First Trust provided to client firm representatives.\n “FINRA’s non-cash compensation rule is designed to protect investors by preventing financial recommendations from being unduly influenced by excessive gifts, entertainment or other perks supplied to broker-dealers or their registered representatives,” said Bill St. Louis, Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement at FINRA .\n FINRA Rule 2341 (Investment Company Securities) prohibits member firms from making payments or offers of payments of any non-cash compensation subject to specified exceptions. For example, the exceptions permit gifts that do not exceed $100 per person and an occasional meal, a ticket to a sporting event, or comparable entertainment so long as the gifts, meals or entertainment are not preconditioned on achievement of a sales target.\n Between at least 2018 and February 2024, First Trust wholesalers regularly violated Rule 2341 by providing to client firm representatives gifts that significantly exceeded the annual limit and meals and entertainment that were so frequent and extensive as to raise questions of propriety. The gifts far exceeded even the higher limit recently proposed by FINRA. In May 2025, FINRA filed a proposal with the SEC to increase the gift limit to $250 annually, and in September, FINRA filed an amended proposal further increasing the limit to $300 annually.\n For example, on more than 25 occasions during the relevant period, two First Trust wholesalers provided client firm representatives two courtside basketball tickets at a cost of approximately $3,200 per pair. In another example, over an 18-month period, various First Trust wholesalers provided one client firm representative entertainment, including tickets to more than 20 concerts and sporting events, with a total value exceeding $31,000. A First Trust wholesaler also preconditioned a gift of tickets to a professional hockey game on a client firm representative selling $1 million in First Trust products to his customers.\n During the same period, First Trust wholesalers falsified internal expense records relating to more than $650,000 worth of non-cash compensation provided to client firm representatives. First Trust sent client firms false and misleading information about the non-cash compensation provided—omitting more than $500,000 worth of gifts, meals and entertainment.\n First Trust also failed to establish, maintain and enforce a supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve compliance with non-cash compensation rules and expense-related recordkeeping requirements.\n In settling these matters, First Trust consented to the entry of FINRA’s findings, without admitting or denying the charges. In addition, the firm agreed to provide annual compliance certifications to FINRA for three years regarding the issues identified in the settlement.\n FINRA makes available disciplinary actions and other information on its Disciplinary Actions Online database. In addition, FINRA publishes on its Monthly Disciplinary Actions page a summary of disciplinary actions against firms and individuals for violations of FINRA rules; federal securities laws, rules and regulations; and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.

This year, 30 military spouses will take steps toward achieving their Accredited Financial Counselor ® (AFC ® ) designation, setting the foundation for meaningful careers in financial counseling.\n Since 2006, the FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship has successfully prepared over 700 military spouses to obtain their AFC certification while building a thriving global network of more financially confident and empowered military families.\n Heather Walrath, an AFC and prior Fellowship recipient, offered her insights on what the opportunity has meant to her and her clients: “The AFC has been crucial in my ability to really empower military families. There are a lot of people operating in this space without the proper training. Having the AFC credential shows my clients that I am committed to continual learning to better support their unique needs. The designation is also very recognized within the DOD community. As an AFC, I\u0027ve really valued the networking and being part of a community that wants to uplift - not only financial counseling professionals - but also the people we serve.”\n By equipping military spouses with the expertise required for flexible, rewarding careers in financial counseling, the Fellowship strengthens financial security and enhances overall readiness across military communities.\n \"Our Military Spouse Fellows continue to demonstrate the profound impact that targeted financial education can have on military families,\" said Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation . \"As this program enters its 20th year, we\u0027ve seen how empowering military spouses with professional skills creates a multiplier effect—strengthening both their own career prospects and the financial resilience of the entire military community.\"\n “This year marks the 20th anniversary of the FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship,” said Rachael DeLeon, Executive Director of AFCPE. “Our latest class joins a passionate and supportive community that is dedicated to improving the financial well-being of military service members and their families. To date, FINRA Fellows have served more than 280,000 individuals, positively impacting military communities across the United States and around the world.”\n The FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship is open to qualifying spouses of active-duty or retired Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard, and Army or Air National Guard or reserve component service members, as well as spouses of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Professionals.

The report provides an in-depth exploration of the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge and experiences of retail investors in the United States.\n As part of the study, researchers asked a sample of investors across the United States a question about investment fraud:\n If you heard about an investment opportunity that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years, would you invest in it? \n 1. Yes \n 2. No \n 3. Don’t know   \n Despite describing guaranteed and very high investment returns, two hallmarks of investment fraud, half of respondents (50%) indicated they would invest in the hypothetical offer, indicating a lack of recognition about the warning signs of fraud. Investors who are younger, less experienced and less knowledgeable about investing are even more likely to say they would invest in the “opportunity.” The data further reveals that investors who engage with investments that can carry greater risk, such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks, as well as those who rely on social media for financial information, are particularly open to a hypothetical investment that promises much more than it can deliver.\n Would invest in a “guaranteed high-return” opportunity \n \n Notably, the differences by income in the proportion of investors willing to invest in the hypothetical offer were less pronounced, with only four percentage-points separating those earning under $50,000 and those earning $100,000 or more.  \n Would invest in a “guaranteed high-return” opportunity \n \n “These findings reveal that a concerning number of investors might be vulnerable to investment fraud,” said Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation . “All investments involve some level of risk, and investors must understand their own risk tolerance to make informed decisions. At the same time, investors must learn to spot the red flags of investment fraud—including the promise of little to no risk with unusually high returns,” she said.\n The full report, part of the FINRA Foundation’s triennial National Financial Capability Study , will provide comprehensive insights to help financial professionals, educators, regulators and others serve and protect investors of all backgrounds and experience levels.\n Additional findings: \n - Investing knowledge: Investors with high investing knowledge were less likely to invest in the hypothetical opportunity than those with low investing knowledge. Thirty-six percent of those with high investing knowledge report they would invest, compared to 49% of those with low investing knowledge.\n - Crypto and meme stock investors: More crypto investors report they would invest in this “opportunity” than non-crypto investors (65% vs. 44%, respectively), while those who have purchased a meme-stock or viral investment are even more likely to look favorably upon the hypothetical investment than those who have not purchased a meme stock (77% vs. 45%, respectively).\n - Influenced by social media personalities: Almost three-quarters (72%) of study respondents who at least sometimes make investing decisions based on the advice of a social media personality said they would invest in the hypothetical opportunity. The survey found those relying on social media would be much more likely to invest than those who don’t (69% vs. 42%, respectively).\n About the National Financial Capability Study \n In 2009, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation launched the first national study of financial capability of adults in the United States. Since its start, the National Financial Capability Study has provided data on multiple indicators of capability—including financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge.\n National Financial Capability Study survey data is collected every three years. The Investor Survey is an online survey of 2,861 U.S. adults who have investments outside of retirement accounts. The data provides detailed information on a wide range of investing topics, such as attitudes towards risk and investing, investor knowledge, and reliance on so-called “finfluencers.”\n More information about the National Financial Capability Study—including reports, data and interactive data visualizations—can be found at www.finrafoundation.org/nfcs .\n About the FINRA Investor Education Foundation \n The FINRA Investor Education Foundation supports innovative research and educational projects that empower Americans with the knowledge, skills and tools to make sound financial decisions throughout their lives.

The Board announced the approval of four rule proposals, approved proposed amendments to FINRA’s pattern day trading rules, and received updates on the  FINRA Forward initiative, the Consolidated Audit Trail and FINRA’s cybersecurity program.\n Rulemaking \n The Board received a progress update on the FINRA Forward initiatives to improve FINRA’s effectiveness and efficiency in pursuing its mission. As part of the initiative to modernize FINRA’s rules, the Board’s Regulatory Policy Committee convened in July and approved four rule proposals in order to accelerate FINRA’s rule modernization efforts as part of FINRA Forward. The following approved proposals have been or will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):\n - several amendments to FINRA corporate financing rules to promote capital formation without lessening investor protections;\n - a revised proposal for outside activities requirements;\n - an  amended gifts proposal , which would further increase the gift limit from $250 to $300; and\n - a  revised proposal to amend the Capital Acquisition Broker (CAB) rules to allow CABs to represent buyers as well as sellers in specified private placement and M\u0026A transactions.\n Continuing its focus on FINRA Forward, at its meeting this week, the Board approved amendments that will replace the day trading and pattern day trading rules, including the minimum equity of $25,000 for pattern day traders, with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. The amendments are a result of FINRA initiating a retrospective review to assess whether the rules needed to be adapted for today’s technological and trading environment. The proposal incorporates feedback FINRA received from member firms, industry groups and investors from the  Regulatory Notice launching the retrospective review. The amendments will be filed with the SEC for approval. \n The Board also discussed a forthcoming Regulatory Notice that will reduce unnecessary burdens and consolidate prior guidance regarding the use of negative consent for the bulk transfer or assignment of customer accounts.\n “The Board’s recent approval and discussion of various rule proposals are a key part of FINRA\u0027s ongoing efforts to enhance its regulatory effectiveness and efficiency through the FINRA Forward initiative,” said  FINRA Board Chair Scott Curtis . “The Board and FINRA’s leadership team will continue to prioritize helping enable member firms to better serve investors and facilitate strong and fair capital markets.”\n Additional Updates \n The Board received an update on FINRA’s cybersecurity program and recent developments regarding the Consolidated Audit Trail.\n The Board also  reaffirmed FINRA’s  Financial Guiding Principles , an integral part of FINRA’s commitment to financial transparency.\n The next FINRA Board meeting is scheduled for December.
