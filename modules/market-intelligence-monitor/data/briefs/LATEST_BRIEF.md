**Source:** [FINRA News Release](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2025/finra-orders-securities-america-pay-2-million-restitution-customers)

FINRA has ordered Securities America, Inc. to pay $2 million in restitution to customers and fined the firm $1 million for failing to reasonably supervise Class A mutual fund recommendations, resulting in unnecessary fees for customers. The firm's failure to implement a system to supervise these recommendations led to more than 1,000 Class A mutual fund switches and over 2,000 short-term sales that were potentially unsuitable or not in the customers' best interest, totaling over $2 million in commissions and fees. This enforcement action highlights the importance of firms supervising representatives' recommendations to ensure they are in customers' best interests and compliant with regulations.
