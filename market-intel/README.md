# Market Intelligence (Working Notes)

This folder contains working notes, evolving structures, and raw signal analysis related to market and regulatory intelligence.

The primary narrative and entry point for this work is:

→ `modules/market-intelligence-monitor/`

Start there for:
- strategic context
- how signals are interpreted
- how market intelligence feeds prioritization

This folder is intentionally exploratory and evolves over time.
