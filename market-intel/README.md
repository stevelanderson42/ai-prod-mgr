# Market Intelligence — Working Notes & Signal Analysis

This folder contains **working notes, exploratory structures, and raw signal analysis** related to market and regulatory intelligence for AI in regulated environments.

It represents the *research and sense-making layer* that informs higher-level product and prioritization decisions.

---

## Why This Folder Exists

In regulated industries, market intelligence is not static or cleanly packaged.

Signals arrive from many sources:
- competitor announcements and product launches
- regulatory guidance and enforcement actions
- industry commentary and adoption patterns
- shifts in risk posture or public scrutiny

This folder exists to capture those signals **as they are observed**, before they are abstracted into strategy or decision frameworks.

It allows ideas to remain exploratory without prematurely forcing them into polished narratives.

## Relationship to the Market Intelligence Monitor Module

The **primary narrative and system-level explanation** of market intelligence lives under:

→ `modules/market-intelligence-monitor/`

Start there if you want to understand:
- the role market intelligence plays in the overall system
- how signals are categorized and interpreted
- how insights feed into AI prioritization decisions

Material in *this* folder may:
- inform that module
- be referenced by it
- eventually be summarized or promoted once patterns stabilize

This folder intentionally contains **more detail and variability** than is appropriate for a first-time reader.

## What Lives Here

Artifacts in this folder may include:

- raw notes on competitor AI activity
- early drafts of signal categorization structures
- observations about regulatory direction or uncertainty
- hypotheses about emerging trends or risks
- partial or evolving frameworks that are not yet finalized

Content here prioritizes **capture and exploration** over completeness or polish.

---

## What Stays Here vs. What Moves Up

As insights mature:

- **Stable frameworks and interpretations** may be reflected in  
  `modules/market-intelligence-monitor/`

- **Raw notes, early hypotheses, and evolving observations** remain here

This separation keeps the module narrative clear while preserving the thinking that led to it.

---

## How to Use This Folder

This folder is best suited for:
- understanding *how* market intelligence was formed
- reviewing underlying signals behind strategic decisions
- exploring early ideas before they were refined

It is **not** intended as the starting point for understanding the system.

## Status

Active and evolving.

Market intelligence is continuously updated as new signals, competitors, and regulatory guidance emerge.
