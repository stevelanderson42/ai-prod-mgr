# Verification Index

This document will map system claims to supporting artifacts (evaluation runs, datasets, scoring outputs, and decision records) as the Regulated AI Workflow Toolkit matures.

At this stage, the repository emphasizes:
- system and lifecycle design
- governance and guardrail patterns
- evaluation frameworks and metrics definitions
- architectural decision-making in regulated environments

Concrete verification artifacts (e.g., evaluation runs, measured outcomes, comparative results) will be indexed here once stable datasets and repeatable scoring processes are introduced.

This approach avoids over-claiming results while preserving traceability as the system evolves.
